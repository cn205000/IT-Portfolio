This folder contains tasks and activities I completed while working with **osTicket**, an open-source **help desk ticketing system**.

## 📝 Tasks

### 1. **Installation**  
   - Installed **osTicket** on a virtual machine.  
   - Configured the web server (Apache) and database (MySQL) for osTicket.  
   - Set up the **osTicket** system and verified successful installation.

### 2. **Post-Installation Configuration**  
   - Configured **Email Piping** for ticket creation from emails.  
   - Set up **user roles and permissions** to control access for agents and users.  
   - Configured **ticket categories**, **priorities**, and **custom fields**.

### 3. **Using osTicket**  
   - Created and managed **tickets** within the osTicket interface.  
   - Assigned tickets to agents, set up **ticket filters**, and used the **dashboard** for monitoring and updates.
