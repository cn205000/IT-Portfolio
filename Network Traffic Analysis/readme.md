# Virtual Machines & Network Traffic Analysis Lab

This folder contains tasks related to setting up **virtual machines** and performing **network traffic analysis** using tools like **Wireshark**.

## 📝 Tasks

### 1. **Creating a Virtual Machine with Azure**  
   - Created a **virtual machine** in **Microsoft Azure**.  
   - Configured the VM with appropriate resources and security settings.  
   - Connected the VM to the network and tested accessibility.

### 2. **Using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**  
   - Configured **RDP** for remote access to the VM.  
   - Connected to the VM using RDP and performed tasks from the virtual desktop.

### 3. **Installing Wireshark & Observing Traffic**  
   - Installed **Wireshark** on the virtual machine.  
   - Captured and analyzed **network traffic** to observe communication between the VM and other network devices.  
   - Learned to use Wireshark filters to isolate specific traffic patterns and protocol analysis.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Gained hands-on experience in setting up and managing **virtual machines** in **Microsoft Azure**.  
- Learned how to configure **RDP** and connect to VMs remotely for administrative tasks.  
- Developed skills in **network traffic analysis** using Wireshark, including protocol and packet analysis.

## 🏁 Next Steps
Next, I plan to explore advanced **network security** concepts and use **Wireshark** for deeper network analysis, including **identifying vulnerabilities** and potential threats.
